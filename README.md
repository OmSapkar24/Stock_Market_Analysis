# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

This project involves analyzing historical stock market data (NIFTY 50) and predicting stock price trends using machine learning. The analysis includes data preprocessing, sentiment simulation based on price movements, feature engineering (such as calculating SMA_50 and RSI), and training a Random Forest classifier to predict stock price trends (up or down). The notebook provides various visualizations to illustrate the stock's behavior, model predictions, and evaluation metrics.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Simulation**: Simulating sentiment analysis based on stock price movements (increase or decrease).
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculating key indicators like Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) and Relative Strength Index (RSI).
- **Machine Learning**: Training a Random Forest model to predict whether the stock price will go up or down.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Various graphs showing stock trends, moving averages, RSI, and prediction results.
